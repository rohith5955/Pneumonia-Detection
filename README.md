# Pneumonia-Detection

Goal: To detect Pneumonia from X-ray images of patients from the trained Convoluted Neural Network using Keras.

Classifying X-ray scans using Convoluted Neural Networks to detect Pneumonia

Content The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.
